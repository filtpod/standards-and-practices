# Python

Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.

Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.

The language's core philosophy is summarized in the document [The Zen of Python (PEP 20)](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/), which includes aphorisms:
```
Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one– and preferably only one –obvious way to do it.[a]
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than right now.[b]
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea – let's do more of those!

## Learning Python for the first time? 
* Take a look at the [Beginners Guide](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide)
* Official [Python Tutorials](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html#tutorial-index)

## Recommendations
* Use black for automatic code formatting: https://github.com/psf/black, preferably in conjunction with Continuous Integration and git hooks.
* Write tests with pytest: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/
* All projects should have a `requirements.txt`, preferably with pinned requirements.
