Once Windows is installed, perform the following tasks in this order:

- (Optional) Install a third-party antivirus product of your choice.
- Activate Windows using a valid license key. If you don't already have one, ask HR about getting one.

- Consider going into Windows Firewall Advanced Settings, and turning on prompts for new blocked programs.
