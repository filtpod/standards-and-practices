# React

## Intro

-   [React.js](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) often referred to as React or ReactJS is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components, created by Facebook.

-   [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) is an open-source mobile application framework created by Facebook to develop applications for Android, iOS, Web and UWP by enabling developers to use React along with native platform capabilities.

## Examples of react based projects

To get more familiar with the structure of a React/React Native based project, below is a list of some repositiories you can look into. If you currently don't have access to any of these projects, please reach out and request access:

-   [bw-project-status](https://github.com/filtpod/bw-project-status)
-   [rn-by-example](https://github.com/filtpod/rn-by-example)
-   [Aerostar](https://github.com/filtpod/Aerostar)
-   [sundial-mobile-app](https://github.com/filtpod/sundial-mobile-app)

## Tools that can be used for unit testing React components

-   [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) is a JavaScript library for creating, running, and structuring tests.
-   [Enzyme](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/) created by Airbnb is a JavaScript Testing utility for React.
-   [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) created by [Kent C. Dodd](https://kentcdodds.com/). Its philosophy is for its test to resemble a real user as much as possible, meaning it typically will not test what happens inside a component (the implementation details) since that's something users wouldn't do.
-   [React Hooks Testing Library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-hooks-testing-library) allows you to create a simple test harness for React hooks that handles running them within the body of a function component, as well as providing various useful utility functions for updating the inputs and retrieving the outputs of your custom hook.

## Helpful React Development Web Plugins

-   [React Developer Tools](https://reactjs.org/blog/2019/08/15/new-react-devtools.html) is a Chrome DevTools extension for the open-source React JavaScript library. It allows you to inspect the React component hierarchies in the Chrome Developer Tools. Supports Hooks, including inspecting nested objects.
    -   [Guide to Using React Developer Tools](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-debug-react-components-using-react-developer-tools) - This guide gives an overview of how to use RDT to inspect component state, props, and hierarchy.
-   [Redux DevTools Extension](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension) for debugging application's state changes. The extension provides power-ups for your Redux development workflow.
