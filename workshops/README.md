# S&P Workshops

## Slide Decks and Videos

These workshops provide continuous training and education for the development team. You can expect a hands-on learning experience so bring your computer, your brain, and lots of coffee. We want every developer to be involved, so please coordinate with your PM to adjust schedules as necessary. Before the workshop we will share any resources or setup instructions required to participate. The spreadsheet below is a compilation of repositories and videos (if available) of Standards and Practices workshops given.
